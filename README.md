# Introduction

We once thought the "**Perfect Github contribution graph**" was just a meme or a form of self-expression.

## We were completely wrong!

While some unique self-assertion issues exist:

There are some other, absolutely sane people took this meme seriously! 

And they are:

As developers, it's hard to see what the graph reveals about a candidate, who might:
- Use GitHub corporate for work
- Have multiple accounts
- Enjoy life outside of coding
- Many other reasons...

However, it's a dead serious information, which may be somewhat theoretically understandable for an intern/junior position, but some HRs do this even for middle role positions.

# Description

So, I built a script to simplify this process for you and improve the "talent recruitment process" for HRs.

## How it works:
1. Create a new private repository on GitHub.
2. Copy the repository link.
3. Run the file `app.py`.
4. You will be asked:
    - `How many commits you want to perform?`
        - Enter a numeric value (e.g., `7`).
    - `Do you want to autocommit every day? Y/N`
        - Press `Y` to schedule daily commits automatically.
        - Press `N` to perform it only once.
5. Done! Your GitHub graph will soon look like this:
